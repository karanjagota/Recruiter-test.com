'To start with 3rd digit is glued to 1' +
' 2nd, 5th, 6th & 8th can only be among 0 2 3 4. Because this is the only combination which would give a single digit number upon summation.' +
'Finding 2nd 4th 6th & 10th digits' +
'2nd cannot be 0 because then 10th also has to be 0  which violates cond. 1. So 2 can be any of 2 3 4.This implies 10th can be any of 4 6 8 respectively. '+
'hence the prod of 2nd & 10th can be any of 8 18 32.'+
'Now 4th is a perfect square.1 is already occupied so 4th can be any of 4 9.'+
'6th can be any of 0 2 3 4 . This implies the prod of 4th & 6th can be 0 8 12-for 4th digit is 4 and 0 18 27 36-for 4th digit is 9. Overall the prod can ' + 
'be any of 0 8 12 18 27 36. '+
'From cond. 7, only feasible choices for prod are 8 & 18. Out of these only 18 can be chosen because it gives four distinct values for 2nd 10th 4th & 6th digits.'+
' Prod 8 does not give distinct values for them thus violating cond. 1.'+
'So digits corresponding to prod 18 are---2nd 10th 4th 6th -- 3 6 9 2' +
'Now others can be determined easily.....'+
' 7th is 7.'+
' the only place left for 5 is 9th digit. '+
'  only place for 4 is 5th digit.'+
' 0 goes to 8th digit '+
'There is just one place left unoccupied, that is 8 is the 1st digit.'+

A thief entered a bank to rob it. Unfortunately, he forgot the actual code. However, he still remembers the following clues :-
 All the digits are from 0-9, and each digit is used exactly once.
The sum of the 2nd, 5th, 6th and 8th digits is a single number.
The 4th digit is a perfect square. 
The 3rd digit is 1. 
The sum of the 4th and the 7th digits is a perfect square. 
The value of the 10th digit is twice that of the 2nd digit. 
The product of the 4th and 6th digits is equal to the product of the 10th and 2nd digits. 
The 5 is next to the 6, but not next to the 4. 
What is the code ?
