'Fill the 8 diagonal cells with 8 bugs. Now the diagonal below and above the main diagonal having 7 cells will have bugs due to start of generation phase.' +
' Similarly diagonal 2 position below and above having 6 cells will have bugs.' +
 'Similarly all cells will be filled diagonally and no cell will remain empty at the end. So answer is 8. Also you can try proving that X is actually 8 and not less than 8.';

Chang had bought a new video game G.A.B - GRID AND BUGS  .
In this video game there would be a 8 x 8 grid having 64 cells in total.
Now, the player has the option of filling any number of the cells with bugs .
A single cell can contain a single bug.
Now after this has been done , generation phase starts in which all the cells
which are empty and have 2 or more neighbouring cells with bugs , get filled with a bug itself.
After playing the video game several times , Chang noticed that sometimes after the generation phase
all the cells have bugs . He derived that at least X cells should be filled with bugs or else the whole board cannot
be filled after generation phase. Now you have to tell what X will be and why?
