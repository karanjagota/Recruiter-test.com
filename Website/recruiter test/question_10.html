Harvard and Karen had bought a new video game for their PS4.
It was a very interesting video game as it was a turn based game.
There were several targets placed in a line.
The player in each shoot down the targets , and after shooting the target it vanishes.
Now , the player whose turn it is could shoot down at least 1 target and at most 2 targets where there
should be no gap in between and no other target between those 2 targets . The person who shoots
down the last target wins the unique game.
Now , we are given that there are 2014 targets placed in a line.
You have to tell who will win if karen takes the first turn and both of them play optimally ?
And what will the answer in general case when we have N targets placed in a line ?
