Mohit, Rajesh, Samarth and Udit are at their monthly business meeting. Their occupations are author, biologist, chemist and doctor, but not necessarily in that order.
 Udit just told the biologist that Samarth was on his way to home. Mohit is sitting across 
from the doctor and next to the chemist. The doctor was thinking that Rajesh was a very good name 
for parent's to choose, but didn't say anything. What is each person's occupation?
