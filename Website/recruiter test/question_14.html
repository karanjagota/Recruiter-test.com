'The product of the houses is 72.'+
'72=1*2*2*2*3*3 '+
'So, there are 11 possible combinations of the sizes in thousand sq ft of 3 houses with their sums= '+
'(1 2 36)=39 (1 3 24)=28 (1 4 18)=23 (1 6 12)=19 (1 8 9)=18(2 2 18)=22(2 3 12)=17 (2 4 9)=15(2 6 6)=14(3 3 8)=14(3 4 6)=13'+

'Ravi says that the sum of the houses is number of buildings over there'+
'On this, Adhiraj first says that he got it. This means that he knows number of '+
'buildings over there and so, he can find out the sizes of the houses by matching '+
'the sum with number of buildings'+

'But, then he realizes he doesnt know for sure. This means he must be confused '+
'between the combinations of houses that give same sum.'+ 
'So, houses have sizes either (2,6,6) or (3,3,8)'+

'Then they start talking about Ravi having a biggest house. Since (2,6,6) doesnt '+
'have one biggest house but two, the answer has to be (3,3,8)'+

'So,the sizes of houses are 3000 sq ft, 3000 sq ft and 8000 sq ft.'

Two engineers, Ravi Batra and Adhiraj Gautam bump into each other after not
having seen each other in 20 years.
'How have you been?' Adhiraj says to Ravi.
'Great!' answers Ravi. 'I have three Bungalows now.'
'Thats really great. How big are they?'
'Well, the product of their size in thousand square feet is 72, and the sum of their
size is same as the number of buildings over there.'
'Right. I got it. Wait . . . I still dont know for sure.'
'Oh, sorry,' says Ravi. 'My biggest bungalows is near marine drive'
'Wonderful! My bungalow is of same size as your biggest one'
Problem: How big are the bunglows of Ravi?
