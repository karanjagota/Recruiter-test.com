Three men in a cafe order a meal the total cost of which is $15. They each contribute $5. The waiter takes 
the money to the chef who recognizes the three as friends and asks the waiter to return $5 to the men.
The waiter is not only poor at mathematics but dishonest and instead of going to the trouble of splitting the 
$5 between the three he simply gives them $1 each and pockets the remaining $2 for himself.
Now, each of the men effectively paid $4, the total paid is therefore $12. Add the $2 in the waiters pocket
 and this comes to $14.....where has the other $1 gone from the original $15?
